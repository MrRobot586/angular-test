## About the autor
My name is Diego, I'm 19 years old and I've been programming since I was 16, I'm a front-end developer and my ultimate goal is to be full-stack.

This small application largely reflects my skills as a developer, however, I have to say that although this is a great sample of my ability, it does not reflect even 50% of my potential, I still have a lot to learn and every day I strive to do so. 

I hope to fulfill your expectations regarding this test, thanks for the opportunity, greetings from Falcon!
